# Angular Search Exercise

## Download

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ptchiangchloe/angular-search-exercise.git
```

## 1. Setup
```bash
npm install
```
- install all npm and bower dependencies

**Note:** If `npm install` fails during dependency installation it will be likely caused by `gulp-imagemin`. In that case remove `gulp-imagemin` dependency from `package.json`, run `npm install` again and then install `gulp-imagemin` separately with following command: `npm install gulp-imagemin --save-dev`

## 2. Watch files
```bash
gulp
```
- all SCSS/HTML will be watched for changes and injected into browser thanks to BrowserSync

## 3. Build production version
```bash
gulp build
```
- this will process following tasks:
* clean _build folder
* compile SASS files, minify and uncss compiled css
* copy and optimize images
* minify and copy all HTML files into $templateCache
* build index.html
* minify and copy all JS files
* copy fonts
* show build folder size

## 4. Start webserver without watch task
```bash
gulp server
```

## 5. Start webserver from build folder
```bash
gulp server-build
```
## 6. Disable Same Origin

If this is only for development or learning purposes, the easiest thing to do is to disable the Same Origin Policy in your browser. Be aware that if you do this, youâ€™re opening your browser up to security risks. Follow these instructions:

Chrome

Firefox

This is more of a last resort. Modifying the server to support CORS or running a proxy are the best approaches.
